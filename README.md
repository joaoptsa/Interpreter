# Interpreter
Interpreter of arithmetic expressions 

Implement in Python an interpreter of a language of arithmetic expressions with definition of variables. Arithmetic expressions must be in prefix notation (Ex: (* 2 6) or (+ 5 x), and the definition of variables must be made by assigning the form (defining x 5). The interpreter's argument is a string of expressions.
